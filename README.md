# Introduction

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @damitagomez23
- Iâ€™m a recent grad from the University of Washington (UW) with a degree in Informatics - Data Science
- I use this space primarily for school projects and side activities.
- Since hosting a portfolio website costs money, I will be using this README file to list and summarize my coding projects. This is also a space for my own record keeping. Feel free to click on the links below and take a look.

# Projects

## University of Washington Informatics Capstone - Spring 2021
- Title: *Wander: A Guide to Exploring Seattle*
- A website that allows users to learn more about restaurants in Seattle's International District from the perspective of the business owner and to hear the stories behind their food (i.e., not Yelp).
- Here is a link to the [project summary](https://ischool.uw.edu/capstone/projects/2021/wander-guide-exploring-seattle) on the capstone website since the website itself if no longer available due to temporary domain hosting for the course of the project.
- The project was also featured in a [news story](https://ischool.uw.edu/news/2021/05/informatics-team-serves-chinatown-restaurants-stories) by the information school if you are interested in learning more.

## UW INFO 478 Final Project - Spring 2021
- Title: *Mental Health Resources Analysis*
- This was a group project for my population health informatics class.
- The purpose of this project was to answer the question **What is more effective at preventing suicide: increasing mental health facilities or human resources?**
- As a group, we looked at taking data from the World Health Organization and researched mental health from multiple perspectives outside of the data to look for the best ways to answer this question for our analysis.

## UW INFO 478 Health Modelling Practice - Spring 2021
- Title: *Assignment 3* (sorry, this was not a major project, so there's not an official title)
- This project was for an assignment for my population health informatics class to practice creating ShinyApps and using datasets for topic research.
- For the record, I am not an expert in population health and cannot speak to the accuracy of the models. These were my best efforts of prediction based on the data I had and what I was learning at the time.

## UW INFO 474 Final Project Continuation - Winter 2021
- Title: *Using Billboard to Data to Look at Changes in Music and Music Consumption Over Time*
- This project is my own continuation of a group project I was a part of in school. I am still working on this out of my own interest and curiosity.
- The original class project can be viewed [here](https://observablehq.com/@uw-info474/group5-investigating-music-changes-over-time).
- The code for this project is not available in GitHub but can readily be seen in Observable below the project content in code blocks.
- Everything was coded using D3, other JavaScript components, and markdown.

## UW Pokemon Club Website - Winter 2020
- Title: *UW Pokemon Club*
- This was a website that I developed with another student for UW's Pokemon Club.
- It has club announcements and an interactive calendar that my partner and I constructed.
- It utilizes a Firebase database in a React app.
- The club has fallen apart, but [the website](https://info340d-au18.github.io/project-stluongxd/) is still running with a fully functioning calendar! ðŸ¥´

## UW INFO 201 Final Project - Winter 2019
- Title: *Compare Universities*
- This project is much older and has not been touched in a while.
- It was another group project where we built everything in R and used a ShinyApp to launch the final product.
- The goal was to allow users a way to compare different universities by various attributes such as location, academic interests, or college types.
- I built the *Academic Majors* page and all of its interactive features as my main contribution to the project.
